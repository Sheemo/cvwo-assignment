# DISCLAIMER: THE PROJECT IS INCOMPLETE DUE TO A PROBLEM WITH RAILS ON MY
MACHINE, WHICH I'VE BEEN TRYING VERY HARD TO RESOLVE BUT TO NO AVAIL. IT
THROWS MANY WEIRD ERRORS AT ME WHEN I TRY TO START THE SERVER AND I HAVE TRIED
GOOGLING THE ISSUE BUT APPARENTLY IT'S NOT A COMMON PROBLEM. THEREFORE, THE
PROJECT SHALL REMAIN IN THIS INCOMPLETE STATE UNTIL I MANAGE TO FIGURE OUT
THE ISSUE

This project is a simple Task Management System that allows users to create tasks
and organize them by an intuitive drag and drop interface. It has been tested
on Ruby 3.0.3 and Rails 6.1.4.4. The database is implemeneted using SQLite3.
The front-end is implemented in React.js.

Presently, users cannot create tasks, but tasks are defined in
app/javascript/test_data.js. These tasks can be dragged around the categories,
which are also defined in app/javascript/test_data.js. The login button is
not functional. There is also a Tasks database for the project.

The proposal for the project can be found in CVWO_Proposal.pdf, which covers
proposed functionality and databases.
